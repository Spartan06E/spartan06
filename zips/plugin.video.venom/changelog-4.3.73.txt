[COLOR red]--[/COLOR][I] Some of you may have heard that TVDB will be going to a paid
    only sub for access to their api.  This would mean every user,
    using an addon that utilizes TVDB's api, would be required to
    pay this fee.  That is the smallest part of the problem. TVDB
    will also deprecate all prior api versions.  Most exo forks utilize
    TVDB's v1 api.  This would mean those addons would be
    required to recode their addon for TVDB v4 api(json vs. xml)
    and each user pays a $12/yr fee, or the developer recode to
    utilize another meta provider for TVShow data.  Frankly my
    position, at this moment, is I'm not going to deal with it and call
    it a day.  It's not a matter of can I but more a matter if I have the
    ambitions to spend my free time doing the work it will require.
    Honestly after two years my ambitions have declined.  So at this
    time it's safe to say that at the end of March Venom will cease to
    exist.  It would still work for movies but shows will no longer work.
    Unless TVDB changes their position on the matter that is the best
    and honest answer I can give people without leaving them in the
    dark what is to come.[/I]
[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.3.7 - Jan. 23, 2021[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed scraper timeout to default 60secs. Should help
    resolve issue with slower devices returning
    "no sources".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Venom logging now has new option "log Level". You can
    now set this for "Normal" or "Debug(Extra Info)".  Normal
    will only log code errors while Debug will log additional
    Info I may require to trace bugs.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Background progress dialog was hidden under some
    configurations, this is now fixed.[/I]
