[B][COLOR lime]Venom Lite - Update - v4.2.11 - Sep 26, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
      Big Changes, Read v4.2.0 news,
      FenomScrapers replaces OpenScrapers, resolveurl no longer used.
      -In FenomScraper Settings turn on Hosters 2ddl, RLSBB and Scenerls
      Must Re-authorize Trakt and Real Debrid in settings and sync with new addon
      called My Accounts.
       - After this update:        
        IN Tools.. Clear ALL Venom Cache
        OpenScrapers and resolveurl should be uninstalled and if you are using addons
        other than Venom then the proper repos for the official OpenScrapers and
        resolveurl releases should be installed and install the offical OpenScrapers and
        resolveurl addons over the ones I had modded.

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.0 – Sept. 26, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Free hoster and foreign scraper support has been removed
    due to limited time to maintain.  Premium hosters supported
    by AD, PM, and RD is still supported.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New scraper pack called "Fenom Scrapers" per above
    changes and OpenScrapers is no longer to be maintained.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Venom now integrates with a new addon to access your
    account information called "My Accounts".  My Accounts
    allows any addon to access the authorized info so if
    adopted by other developers it would eliminate the
    need to authorize in every addon you use.
    This does however require a new initial setup.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.1.0 – Sept. 03, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "File Name Format" option to downloads.  You
    have the option of "Title (year) or Title S01E01", which is
    the older file naming method.  Or you can chose
    "torrent file name".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed random issue where meta fallback would replace
    "tvshowtitle" with episode "title".  This caused issues with
    OpenInfo or TMDbHelper failing lookup of the show.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed playback issue with OpenInfo where video playing
    was in background.  This occurred when a search was
    performed first and then accessing OpenInfo to play
    from.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed "My Movies" "Date Added" sorting.  Previously it
    was stuck at descending sort order due to Trakt api key
    for "listed_at" was not assigned.  This is now fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed "Unfinished" in My Movies and My TV Shows
    to "Continue Watching".  Limit has been reduced to 40
    items. Trakt On Deck is now removed as this was the
    same list with only 20 items so I feel this was a good
    compromise. Sort order is now set to be based on date
    paused.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] "reuselanguageinvoker" is now officially hard coded on.
    There is a new service settings management system
    courtesy of Tikipeter,  so credit goes to him!!![/I]  There
    is still an option for user to turn this off if not comfortable.
