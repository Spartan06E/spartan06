[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New "traktSync.db" has been added. When user
    enables the "Trakt" category setting "Enable scrobbling",
    and also sets "Resume Point source" to "Trakt scrobbles",
    an initial sync will retrieve your complete Trakt Progress for
    all Movies and Shows.  At any time playback is stopped,
    before the normal 85% for "mark as watched", the
    scrobble pause will be saved to local db as well as sent
    to Trakt to maintain synchronization.  A service check is
    performed at 15 minute intervals to compare the latest
    "paused_at" db entry with that from the Trakt api.  This
    assures that another device in your home will get
    updated for changes.  This maintains sync across
    multiple devices.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] For the item above a new option has been added
    to the "Trakt Manager" called "Scrobble Reset".  This
    removes the given item from the local db and sends
    "progress=0" to Trakt "scrobble/start".  A 
    "container.refresh()" is then issued so 
    the changes are seen instantly.[/I]
